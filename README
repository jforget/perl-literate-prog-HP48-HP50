This  project is  a mini-framework  for developping  programs  for the
HP-48 and  HP-50 in User-RPL.   Maybe it works  for HP-49, but  I have
none available. Likewise, I have not digged into System-RPL.

It is  based on Knuth's idea  of literate programming,  where a single
file contains all which is necessary  to produce both the code and the
documentation.

This  project is developped  in parallel  with another  project, which
will be a  testcase for literate programming generation.  As a result,
there  may  be  discrepancies  between  the  software  description  in
"description.hpweb" and what it actually does in "genere-hpweb".

Later, this project has been adapted to develop programs for the HP-41
and for the APL language.  Not all HP-48/HP-50 functions are used, but
the basic tangling and weaving are used.

Installation:

You need  a Unicode-friendly  Perl, that  is a late  5.8 version  or a
later  version,   5.10  or   more.   You  will   need  to   install  a
Unicode-friendly version of  YAML (0.72 maybe?). And you  will have to
install  GraphViz  and its  Perl  module  GraphViz2.pm. Then  download
genere-hpweb and run it.

If you have another YAML interpreter, just modify all calls to YAML to
use the other interpreter's namespace and functions (if different).
