This project is a mini-framework for developping
programs for the HP-48 and HP-50 in User-RPL.
 
It is based on Knuth's idea of literate programming,
where a single file contains all which is necessary
to produce both the code and the documentation.

This project is developped in parallel with
another project, which will be a testcase for
literate programming generation.

For now, no installation instructions. Just read
the F*ing source and guess how it will be used.
